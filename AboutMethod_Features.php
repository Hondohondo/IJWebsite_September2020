                  <h1>Features and Principles of the Method </h1>

                  <p>
                    The <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> method is an integrated system of writing exercises to access and work with your experiences and feelings for gaining awareness about your life.
                    Our certified leaders guide you step-by-step in an atmosphere of privacy and reflection.
                    Here are some of the method's major features.
                  </p>

                  <h6><em>Intensive Journal</em> Workbook: Mirroring the Growth Process </h6>

                  <p>
                    The structure of sections and corresponding writing exercises in the workbook mirror the subjective process of perceptions, thoughts, etc. taking place inside yourself.
                    Designed with minimal terminology, these procedures provide the means for moving directly into your own inner process and drawing forth emotions and experiences to make them accessible and tangible for further development.
                  </p>
                  <h6>Journal Feedback&trade; Technique: A Dynamic Process  </h6>

                  <p>
                    Structured as an active instrument, the <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook helps you generate momentum through cumulative entries.
                    Through the Journal FeedbackTM process, you avoid self-conscious analysis and preconceived ways of thinking to overcome blockages and foster breakthroughs.
                     You view issues from different angles to realize connections and to create integrations of awareness.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Inner Development: Evoking Your Potential</h6>

                  <p>
                  Focusing on inner development, our method provides an integrated system for connecting with your true self.
                   Our workshops provide a progressively deepening atmosphere, away from your daily routine, for experiencing the exercises as they are applied to your life.
                    Non-judgmental and non-analytical approaches further the evoking process.
                  You become immersed in your own growth, drawing forth your unique potential and unfolding life process.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Whole-Life Process: Greater Perspective and Safety </h6>

                  <p>
                    Progoff’s approach of working through issues in the context of your entire life provides important benefits of perspective and safety.
                    Greater awareness about a wide range of experiences creates a foundation for making decisions.
                    Issues can be viewed in a larger context and become more manageable.
                    Using Progoff&trade; techniques allows for issues to develop, avoiding premature judgments.
