                  The Entrance Meditation experience is integral to the <em>Intensive Journal</em> process.
                   After entering our inner space through the Entrance Meditation process, we record our images in the <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook. Stimulating our inner processes, we continue with the meditations and proceed to progressively deeper levels in our Journal work.
