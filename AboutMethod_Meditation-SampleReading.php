                    Muddy/Clear: The Mirror of the Water<br>
                    From the The Well and the Cathedral: An Entrance Meditation Reading,<br>
by Ira Progoff, Ph.D.

                  </h6>

                  <div class="para-sample">
                    <ol>
               <p>  <li>
                    I remember the saying<br>
                      Of the old wise man, Lao Tse:<br>
                      "Muddy water,<br>
                      Let stand<br>
                      Becomes clear."</li>
                  </p>

                  <p><li>
                    Thinking of that,<br>
  I look within myself.<br>
  I see,<br>
  On the screen of my mind's eye,<br>
  A stream of water,<br>
  Moving,<br>
  Swirling,<br>
  Murky,<br>
  It is full of things.<br>
  I cannot look into this water.<br>
  I cannot see my reflection<br>
  In this water.
</li>  </p>

                  <p><li>
                    Now the movement stops.<br>
    The water is in one place.<br>
    It is heavy colored,<br>
    Muddy<br>
    But it is becoming quiet,<br>
    The water is at rest<br>
    In its stillness<br>
    The muddiness<br>
    Is settling to the bottom.
  </li>  </p>

                  <p><li>
                    At the surface it becomes clear,<br>
    Transparent.<br>
    I can see into the water<br>
    More and more.<br>
    Now I can see through<br>
    To the very depth of it.<br>
    There it shines<br>
    And it reflects.<br>
  </li></p>
                  <p><li>
                    The heavens are reflected<br>
  In the quiet water.<br>
  It is clear.<br>
  I see the reflection of a tree<br>
  In the quiet water.<br>
  The muddy water<br>
  Has become clear.</li>
</p>
                  <p><li>
                    As I continue to look<br>
  Into the stillness<br>
  A reflection of myself<br>
  Begins to appear.<br>
  Deep in the quietness<br>
  Of the water,<br>
  I see<br>
  A reflection of myself,<br>
  Myself<br>
  In many different forms.</li>
</p>
                  <p><li>
                    I sit<br>
                    In the stillness<br>
                    And let the image shape itself.<br>
                    It becomes many things.<br>
                    Many images<br>
                    Appear in the still water,<br>
                    Many things<br>
                    Come up for me to see.</li>
                  </p>
                  <p><li>
                    In the depth of the water,<br>
  The images<br>
  That open the greatest vision<br>
  Within me<br>
  Are not those that are visible.<br>
  I do not see them;<br>
  I just know them.<br>
  Something within me<br>
  Recognizes them<br>
  In the still water.</li>
                  </p>
                  <p><li>
                    The muddy water has become quiet.<br>
                    I sit gazing into it,<br>
                    Seeing images,<br>
                    Visible and invisible,<br>
                    Letting them take form,<br>
                    Letting them change<br>
                    And re-form themselves<br>
                    In the depth of the still water,<br>
                    In the mirror of the water,<br>
                    In the depth of my Self,<br>
                    Moving, moving,<br>
                    In the Silence ... In the Silence.</li>
