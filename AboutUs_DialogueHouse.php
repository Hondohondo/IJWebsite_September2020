                  <h5>Serving Diverse Audiences: New Directions and Opportunities</h5>

                  <p>
                    Dialogue House Associates is the administrative headquarters for the programs and materials of Ira Progoff, Ph.D.
                    Our office is located in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.
                  </p>
                  <p>Our programs go well beyond the workshops that are offered to the public.
                  We offer a broad range of services to specialized audiences in the following areas:</p>

                  <h6>Public</h6>
                  <p>
                    Organizing and coordinating approximately 150 public <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshops annually.
                     We offer introductory programs as well as the advanced modules.
                     Extended programs offer participants an opportunity to experience the full method in a continuous experience.
                     Programs are offered year-round both in the United States, Canada and overseas.
                     Our goal is to offer affordable and accessible workshops in the major metropolitan areas so that people have a structured setting to work in the method on an ongoing basis.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Continuing Education</h6>
                  <p>
                    We are an approved provider of continuing education to counselors and social workers.
                    Professionals begin to learn Progoff’s theories of growth through a direct experience in their own lives in a workshop setting.
                    The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method is an important resource to complement the counseling process.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Wellness</h6>
                  <p>
                    Wellness programs and applications. Here are some major areas:
                      </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                          Prevention/Ongoing wellness.
                          Our program offers an effective way to strengthen the mind-body connection, reduce stress and help people develop more meaningful lives.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        Employee wellness.
                        Organizations offer our program as a tool for employee wellness. Employees become more productive by:
                          <ol start="1">
                          <li>resolving issues in their personal lives or in the workplace,</li>
                          <li>reducing stress, and</li>
                          <li>stimulating their creativity capacities.</li>
                          </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Mental health. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can serve as an effective complement to therapy or provide an alternative means to develop a person’s life.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Patient populations. Research studies are desired at major medical centers to document how the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can help people cope with
                         the emotional challenges of having a serious illness (e.g. cancer), or to deal with issues that may have contributed to an illness (e.g. an addiction).
                      </li>

                    </ul>

                  <h6>Ministers</h6>
                  <p>
                    We offer programs for the professional development of ministers and related professionals at leading seminaries, sabbatical programs and retreat centers.
                  Our program is neutral with regard to any particular faith.
                  </p>


                  <h6>Social Service programs</h6>
                  <p>
  The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can be used effectively by participants with only a modest level of education.
   We offer workshops in the following settings:
                   </p>
                   <p>
  Criminal Justice. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can transform offenders in a deep and long-lasting way as they find answers about life for themselves.
   Improved behavior and changed attitudes results in less violence, reduced recidivism, and greater possibilities for becoming a constructive member of society.
</p>
<p>
  Family Services. People who have faced traumatic experiences (e.g. rape or domestic violence) have used the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method to rebuild their lives.
   The method connects a person to their underlying capacities in a non-threatening way.</p>
<p>
  Job training. Trainees attend <em>Intensive Journal</em> sessions while they are being trained in entry level positions.
   Our program contributes to improved attitudes leading to higher rates of completion, job performance and promotion.</p>
                  </p>


                      <h6>Training our program leaders</h6>
                  <p>
                    Offering advanced professional training for individuals to become certified leaders of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method (Advanced Studies Program)
                  </p>



                    <h6>Books and audio materials<span> (Dialogue House Library)</span></h6>
<p>
Dr. Progoff authored 14 books on the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method, depth psychology, meditation, C.G. Jung’s theories, and mysticism. Progoff’s audio materials provide an effective way
to learn more about his unique theories of self-development and benefit from <em>Entrance Meditation</em>&trade; readings.

<h6>Fund-raising</h6>

<p>
Tax-deductible contributions are an important way that we can continue to offer these services.
 Progoff established a separate organization, The Foundation for Integral Research (FIR) to help fund, through tax-deductible donations, the development of his programs and materials in psychology, including the <em>Intensive Journal</em> program. Contributions are most welcome.
   <strong>FIR's 501(c)(3) status is inactive so donations are not presently deductible</strong>.
