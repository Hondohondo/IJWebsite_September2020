                  We are offering online workshops through the Zoom teleconferencing service.  We list the "location" because we are encouraging you  to sign up for a program in your geographic area.   This policy will help to create a local feel for the program that exists in an in-person program.  Naturally, if you do not live in an area where a workshop is offered, or the dates in your area do not work for you, then sign up for a program that does.
                  </p>

                  <p class="u-margin-bottom-small-1">
                    Any module that has the letters "ONL" designates that the workshop is being held online.  Example:  LC-ONL is a Life Context module that is held online.
                  </p>

                  <p class="u-margin-bottom-small-1">
                    Please register early.  We have to ship you the Intensive Journal workbook prior to the conference. Thank you for your cooperation.
