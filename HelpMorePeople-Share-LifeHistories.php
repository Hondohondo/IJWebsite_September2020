                      Have you used the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method extensively to deal with a particular issue in your life?  Then, you may wish to write a 2-4 page summary of how our method helped you.  We call them "life histories" and we have many examples on our website. <a href="Learnmore_LifeHistories.php" class="page-link no-margin">Life Histories</a>   We sometimes offer tuition scholarships to our program in return for writing a successful life history.  The possible topics are wide ranging - see topics listed.
