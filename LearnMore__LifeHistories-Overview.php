                      Many people have used the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method to work through prominent issues in their lives.  It has helped them move through an important transition, work through powerful feelings about an emotional or physical issue, and come to terms with an unfortunate occurrence (death of a family member, illness).

                    <p>
                        They have described this important issue that was affecting them, and how the <em>Intensive
                            Journal</em> method helped them deal with it over time.  We call these writeups "life histories."    They provide dramatic examples of how the
                    <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can make a meaningful difference in a person's life.
