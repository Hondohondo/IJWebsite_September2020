                      Dialogue House conducts 1-3 hours introductions of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method for organizations that can organize a group of 12-15 people.  Now with Zoom, it is much more feasible to conduct these introductory sessions.</p>

                      <p>


                      Participants learn key principles of the method and then experience sample writing exercises. They can then elect to enroll in a full-length (2 day) workshop to continue learning the process. </p>

                      <p>


                      You can help more people learn about the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method by urging an organization to host an introductory session.  Dialogue House would be glad to work with your contact to make the event a success.
                  </p>
