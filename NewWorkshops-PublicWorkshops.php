                      Organizations that can organize a group of 12-15 people can host or sponsor a full-length (2 day) workshop.  Sponsors are responsible for promoting the program and registering participants, and in return, earn a percentage of the revenue. </p>

                      <p>Dialogue House will arrange many of the details concerning workshop materials (mailing the workbooks, booking a workshop leader).  We work step-by-step with each sponsor concerning promotion and other details to ensure that the workshop can run smoothly.  </p>

                      <p>At present, workshops are conducted online.  We are monitoring the situation and will the situation in consultation with each sponsoring organization.

                        We can use your help in obtaining an introduction to an organization that may wish to sponsor.  Personal referrals are vital for obtaining sponsors, just as you may have learned about the method.  Possible sponsors include growth centers, churches, counseling centers, writing groups, etc.- any group that can organize a group.   We welcome the opportunity to bring an
                        <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshop to your area.
