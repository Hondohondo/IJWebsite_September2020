                    The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method provides a compatible approach for your mindfulness practice for
obtaining self-awareness about your life experiences. Summarized below are some of the techniques
that can be applied through <em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises to create many possible benefits.
                  </p>

<h6>Compatible Approaches with Mindfulness</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    Adopt a non-judgmental attitude, becoming receptive to working
with a full range of experiences and feelings, as a basis for
developing a foundation for your life
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus inward in a neutral, unbiased way to the source of direct
knowing, your true inner self.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adopt no expectations or time frames for answers to issues or
making decisions; awareness comes when it is ready to reveal
itself as you adopt an approach of passive receptivity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work in silence to become centered and focused to access your
inner self.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employ a non-analytical approach, avoiding preconceived and
circular ways of thinking, to achieve creative breakthroughs of
awareness
  </li>
  <li>
    Work in total privacy to be free to be honest and true to your self.
  </li>
</ul>
