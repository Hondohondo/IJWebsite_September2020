                Use the inner dialogue exercises to work through the bereavement process. Dr. Progoff was fond of quoting: “Death ends a life, but it does not end a relationship.”* You can deepen your relationship, gain peace and understanding, even with those who are deceased.
                </li>
                <li>
                View the relationship within the context of your entire life using Progoff’s “whole life process.”

                Use the insights about the relationship to take next steps in your life. You can heal old wounds, bring greater harmony, and reduce interfamily tension.

                <li>
                Revisit and deepen your understanding of the relationship as you work in the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method over time.
