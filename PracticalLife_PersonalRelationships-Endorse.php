                    <strong>On Bereavement </strong><br>
                  Yet I was sustained. The power and process of the Progoff <em>Intensive Journal</em> Method and the writing retreats brought a sanctuary for my heart and soul. On the pristine white pages and through the rhythmic flow of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> process itself I have poured out my sorrow and confusion and anger and questions. I have gained entry to locked rooms of feelings and unfinished conversations, been able to rest in the emptiness that canâ€™t be filled except by acceptance and mourning. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> Method has been a friend, a refuge, a treasure, and a lover offering a compassionate, non-judgmental ear to hear all the voices needing to speak.

                    <strong>On troubled relationships  </strong><br>
                  By dialoguing in my <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook, I was able to comfort that scared woman inside me and help her understand the pain was too great, that change needed to happen. During this time, doing this work, I no longer needed to blame my husband so much. I saw he was deeply hurting and in need of help that I could not possibly give him. I began to just take care of myself and stop trying to make him and our marriage better. A couple months later I was living in a place of my own, with so much healing work ahead.
