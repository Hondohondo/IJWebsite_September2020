          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>Dr. Progoff was a pioneer in using dialogue techniques to help you gain a deeper understanding of various
            areas of your life, including personal relationships.  </p>
          <p>These techniques enable you to enter into a genuine dialogue relationship with another person.  The steps
            that you are led through help you &quot;walk in the shoes&quot; of the other person to create a more
            authentic dialogue.   </p>
          <p>Personal relationships include a broad range of people  whether from your family, work, or elsewhere, as 
            well as those who are deceased.   Dr. Progoff believed that death ends a life but not a relationship, and
            we can use our dialogue techniques to deepen our understanding of those who are no longer with us, which
            has important benefits for the bereavement  process.       </p>
          <p>You also learn how to view a relationship from different perspectives using other dialogue exercises.  For
            example, you may wish to engage in a dialogue with your spouse.  Then, you may enter into a dialogue with
            the marriage itself which has a life and existence of its own.  By viewing an issue from different angles,
            you can obtain new perspectives that may not be possible through a dialogue directly with your spouse.</p>
