                  <p>
                  Retirement is one of the big transitions in life. Being retired is perhaps now a reality for you, no longer a distant situation in your future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                Many aspects of our life change: daily routine, priorities, how we think of ourselves, and how others relate to us. Major financial adjustments and planning may be necessary. We may need to reassess where we live. Family concerns may be especially relevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Our emotions and thought process are stirring during this time of change. We realize that we are entering another distinct phase of life that offers great promise and possibilities, but is filled with challenges and uncertainty.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We want our retirement to be special and meaningful, but how do we decide what to do? How do we get a handle on all of the different aspects of our life?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You will learn a unique way to take stock of the many facets of your unique life: family relationships, accomplishments, interests, concerns, and priorities. From this foundation, you can take steps to develop a cohesive plan for developing your retirement.
