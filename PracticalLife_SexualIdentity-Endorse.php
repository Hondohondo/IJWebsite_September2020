                    "As a child and young man, I felt that God had abandoned me because of who I am, and therefore, I prayed to have my sexual identity taken away. I thought there must be something wrong with me, having grown up in a male dominated Latino machismo culture, and being a member of a religion that espouces the concept of a condemning "god" who believes that homosexuality is a sin.

        <strong><em>The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method</em></strong> has helped me deepen the experience of my sexual identity. Using the Journal,  I have been able to bring all of these contradictions into perspective in a very safe way, allowing me to  embrace them and become whole again."

    "For over 40 years, as a gay man,<strong><em> the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method</em></strong> has been a "Home" for me to meet and address and work out life strategies. Now in my senior years, I confidently face the on-going question that has always emerged, "What does my life want to become?"

                  <blockquote>
    "<strong><em>The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method </em></strong>helped me come to terms with and embrace my sexual identity. Through the Journalâ€™s many different writing experiences, I was able to draw connections and open doorways long held shut by social disapproval and my own internalized shame. I found myself informed and in touch again with positive aspects of myself which had been repressed or hidden. I put into perspective and found a larger context for many issues previously felt overwhelming. I gained an understanding of my sexual identity's unique perspective and the rich gifts an alternative point of view provides to a life well constructed within the mainstream community. I highly recommend<strong><em> the <em>Intensive Journal</em> </em></strong>journey for all in the LGBT Community".
