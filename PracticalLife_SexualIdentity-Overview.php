                  <h1>Overview</h1>

                  <p>
                  Being a member of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) community in today's society can result in a complex set of emotions and pressures. Societal norms can result in a lack of self-esteem, repression of thoughts and life style, and an internalized shame that leads to a lack of connection with one's true identity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                The <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshop provides LGBT participants with a sanctuary from which to work through their most intimate feelings in a safe, supportive and non-judgmental environment.  Using the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method is an ongoing process of growth, which participants may choose to continue after the workshop experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                Our method provides a practical way for members of the LGBT community to foster greater self-acceptance, and to embrace their sexuality as they connect with their unique self. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method is an energizing process that enables participants to connect with different aspects of their lives that may have been repressed or denied. Through this process, a healthier and more meaningful life can ensue.
                  </p>
