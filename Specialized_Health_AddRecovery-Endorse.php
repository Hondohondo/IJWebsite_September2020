                "The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method was an integral part of my recovery. The organization of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook allowed me to pull from inaccessible parts of my life and bring them into a synthesis that enabled me to make better life-affirming decisions. It helped me to be more in control of my life. Through these workshops, I was empowered to make a career change to be a substance abuse professional. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method has helped me deal with life's adversity and work through transitions. I am immersed in a positive addiction to the Progoff™ method and I highly recommend the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method to substance abuse professionals."

            <br class="u-margin-bottom-small">  1) a nonjudgmental way to approach the events and movements in one's life;
            <br>  2) a gentle and compassionate approach to sensitive personal aspects of one's life that are often colored by shame, ambivalence, confusion;
            <br>  3) a way to bring hope as insights from journal entries can suggest a way "out" and "through" painful and toxic situations of addiction;
              4) a sense of the movement of one's life, which is core to the <em>Intensive Journal</em> process, that empowers an individual who can feel "stuck" in addiction to bring hope and vitality to their lives."
