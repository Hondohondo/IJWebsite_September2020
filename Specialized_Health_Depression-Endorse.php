              "My body feels fat and my heart heavy, both weighed down by a dense fog of depression and grief....For many years, I have used the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method as a guide out of the darkest places of pain; no  matter how lost I  feel....The weeks and months following the suicide of my brother-in-law were among the darkest times I have known....The <em>Intensive Journal</em> process offered me the structure and tools for healing and growth...Using the process, one can work through seemingly overwhelming feelings of abandonment, emptiness, and anger, and eventually find a way to peace."

                    <blockquote>
              "I had to confront the issue of sexual abuse again. I was so anxious, angry and depressed...The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method helped me to access and develop these aspeects of my life and broadened my awareness of new possibilities for me. I realized that I had defined my life narrowly.  In dealing with my depression I realized that I was in survival mode.  It had never occured to me to see my life as having positive aspects to it, as somehow trying to evolve.  As I worked in these different areas of my <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook, clues about my interests surfaced."
