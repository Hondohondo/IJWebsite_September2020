                  <h1>Practical Ways to Help Patients</h1>
                  <p>
                    As participants use the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method, they develop new awareness about their lives, which
gives them the ability to grow as individuals. Here are some of the many ways that your patients can use
our method to develop themselves.
                  </p>

                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
                  Foster Self-Empowerment to Overcome Their Challenges
                  </h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Patients connect to their inner capacities to draw forth new
resources to grow and develop, overcoming the challenges created by
an illness. They are better able to handle the tension, uncertainty
and physical demands placed upon them physically and emotionally.
Maintaining a constructive attitude leads to a more active life style.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
                Coping and Making Sense of the Illness
                  </h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Patients become more actively engaged in determining the
next phases of their total treatment program. They become more proactive
in developing plans to help themselves, conscious of changes in
their condition, and aware of the consequences of destructive behavior.</li>

                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
                Deepen Self-Understanding
                  </h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Working in privacy creates safety for patients to be honest
with themselves to accurately describe issues in their lives.</li>
<li>
  Patients connect more deeply with their true selves which
may have been overshadowed by the illness. They develop a broader
perspective, realizing possibilities in life beyond the illness.
</li>
<li>
  Greater acceptance of the existence of the illness becomes
possible, which leads to a process of dealing with the condition and its
consequences. Patients view their lives as an unfolding process and
realize connections between illness and other facets of life.
</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
                Work Through Other Issues
                  </h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Issues are clarifed that had become clouded or complicated
by illness. Patients learn a new approach for continuing self-growth
and developing other aspects of their lives. Resolving issues generates
energy and momentum and reduces anxiety and stress.</li>
