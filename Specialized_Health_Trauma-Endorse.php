            "In life, crises do happen, and when an extreme trauma occurred in my life, the <em>Intensive Journal</em> process was most significant in helping me to maintain balance and unravel some destructive painful confusion...At times when I experienced 'body flashbacks' of pain or trauma, dialogues [<em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises] allowed me to gain meaning and integration. Therapists often say, 'If you can feel it, you can heal it', and with that I kept moving forward in my recovery process using the method."D Mathers
