                      "As a Kaizen-Muse Creativity Coach and Licensed Professional Counselor, I will be forever grateful for
      the wonderful tools that I learned from the Progoff <em>Intensive Journal</em> training. My clients benefit deeply
      from writing to plumb the multi-dimensional layers of their lives and to access inner wisdom, intuition,
      balance and creativity. One of the most profound gifts of this program is to learn to live with the question
      “What is this life becoming?” as a way to navigate and trust the challenges and direction of our lives. I
      can think of no better depth training in the writing process that offers such invaluable resources to enrich
      one's personal and professional life."
