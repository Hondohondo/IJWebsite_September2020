                "Some people find working with their thoughts and feelings through the written word to be their most profound spiritual discipline. One of the most popular, and most profound, is the <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> developed by Ira Progoff...These descriptions should give you some idea of the rich opportunities for insight available in the Progoff Journal. I encourage you to attend a Progoff workshop ...I found the workshop to be a wonderful time to pull together the ragged edges of my life. If you can't attend a workshop, get a copy of Progoff's book <em>At a Journal Workshop</em>....for some of you this discipline will open many doors to your inner life."

                "I have also found some forms of journaling to be helpful...my colleagues have suggested the Progoff technique. Ira Progoff’s journaling aims to help persons achieve harmony within themselves, with those around them (past and present), and with their life situation. It is a system of dialogue that helps a person identify and work through "unfinished business" from the past and be more fully and freely available for ministry in the present. ...pastors who are already serving may find the Progoff methods helpful."
