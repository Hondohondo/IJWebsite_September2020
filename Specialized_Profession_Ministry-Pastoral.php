                  <p>
                The <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> method can serve a valuable role in achieving the objectives set forth by the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education in your clinical pastoral education program. Our program provides valuable skills for those who then move forward to become chaplains in an institutional setting.
                  </p>

<h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
Use a Leading Methodology For Writing and Self-Reflection
</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Apply an integrated system that deepens the reflection process in a sustained contemplative atmosphere for awareness and perspectives.</li>
  <li>Utilizing sound theoretical principles of psychology, the Progoff methodology provides proven techniques to use in your institution.</li>
</ul>
<h6 class="u-margin-top-small">
Foster Self-Awareness in the Workplace
</h6>
<ul>
  <li> Use specialized exercises that are designed to make tangible and accessible details of issues for further assessment and review.</li>
  <li>Learn ways to approach issues from different perspectives to be more effective working in an interdisciplinary team environment.</li>
  <li>Become more attentive and observant of situations as you work through details of issues over time.</li>

</ul>




    <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">

  <li>Access beliefs using a neutral process without dogma, well-suited for working in an interfaith setting.</li>
  <li>Learn an important complement to counseling, providing approaches that are especially helpful for people in crisis.</li>

</ul>

  <blockquote>
    [T]he  <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> method and Progoff's embodiment of his holistic depth
    psychology in the  <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> process have been my major theoretical and
    structural approach to awareness, life, and ministry. As a priest, chaplain, and
    minister, I have found that the method can provide a comprehensive approach for
    bringing my life together...and providing strategies for working through relationships, meaning
    in life, and depth experiences. I particularly recommend the  <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> method for all
    involved in ministry and human services.

  <blockquote>
    The skills I learned in <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> workshops served me invaluably
  as a hospital chaplain. I found myself more able to name and address the unaddressable
  in the midst of the thick of life. In my reflective time, I used the method to "find voice for
  that which speaks as 'deep to deep.'"

  <blockquote>
"This [<em>Intensive Journal</em>] program was very helpful in establishing a reflective mind set in my students and in providing them a conceptual framework for organizing their journal writing. The workshop affected a more uniform reflective style of writing [and] this carried over into their participation in clinical and peer group process seminars. The  <em><em>Intensive Journal</em></em> workshop provided a strong start for the CPE program."
