The continual working back and forth between the interpretation of past experience and the yearning for new directions allows for the development of realistic plans that carry their own motivations. This is a valuable experience."

While state and national standards encourage reflective practice with respect to their teaching, these teachers freely admit they need times and seasons for even deeper reflection, reflection that engages their hearts and souls, balances their busy and complicated lives, and taps the inner wells of creativity that can keep them going."

"The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method is a set of inner tools that accomplishes exactly that: teachers re-encounter themselves and their lives more deeply through the workshop and find both meaning and fresh energy through the momentum of the exercises. Highly recommended for teachers who need a time-out for themselves!"
