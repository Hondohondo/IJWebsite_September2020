                The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can help teachers develop professionally in many different ways. Our program provides teachers with reflective approaches to reinvigorate their passion for teaching, clarify thinking about their teaching skills and practices, and discover ways of developing their career.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Teachers have used our program to cope with the human reality of teaching in the modern age that can negatively affect their performance. Reducing stress and exhaustion, and preventing burnout are two common examples.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    English teachers find our program especially valuable since they learn practical skills to stimulate and enhance writing by their students. Our program may also reconnect teachers with their passion for writing and teaching.
                  </p>

                <p>
                  We have conducted workshops that are sponsored by public school districts. See Special Projects. Many teachers attend our public workshops as well, especially our summer retreats.
