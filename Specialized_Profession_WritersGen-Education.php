          Teaching writing to future generations is an important job for educators. The Progoff <em>Intensive Journal</em> method allows for the improvement of writing skills in many areas, including education, and has been sponsored by a chapter of the National Writing Project, an organization whose goal is to improve writing in America. The NWP reaches those who teach writing or use writing in their teaching.

                The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method helps prepare the educator to teach, by allowing for self-discovery and awareness. Using selected exercises from the <em>Intensive Journal</em> notebook, the educator can help the student take a greater interest in writing, facilitating and establishing a fluency with the written word. The method reveals the personal value that writing has, producing self-understanding, insight, and a greater depth of expression. Self-awareness is an integral aspect of education, and can be fostered by the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method. It helps writers (both educators and students) investigate various areas in a personal way, exercising oneâ€™s expression, serenity, and self-exploration.
