                  "The Progoff <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can be a most powerful tool for both those who are writing memoirs, or those who are coaching or teaching memoir writing. Unresolved issues from the past that affect one’s ability to be a complete person in the present and future can make memoir writing unnecessarily painful and non-productive. For me, the Progoff method’s greatest impact was in teaching me how to revisit the past in a positive way, from my present perspective, to help resolve issues and relationships in the past that needed healing. The Progoff method helped me realize I already have everything within myself to be my complete and whole self.</blockquote>
