          Leading writers have used the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method to spur their creativity and thereby enhance their writing process. Now you can use this powerful inner journey to become more successful in your writing.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Some of the exercises lend themselves directly to the writing process. Progoff is a leader in developing the dialogue technique. You can also learn how to use imagery and symbolism to enhance your writing. More broadly, the deepening inner journey of the workshop process can provide unpredictable insights in many different areas of your life.
