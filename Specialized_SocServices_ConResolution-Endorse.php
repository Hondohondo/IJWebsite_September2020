                  "My experiences with the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method have made me a far better person....there was a time when I just purely hated white people, just hated them.   A white guy did something to me once in a restaurant that hung with me for a long time.  And I wanted to kill him so bad I didn't know what to do. But I didn't kill him till maybe a year and a half later.  I killed him in my Journal with my ballpoint pen... <br class="u-margin-bottom-small-1">After that experience I found out that by hating something or somebody, that I was only hurting myself.  I wasn't hurting the people I was hating.  This came out of the Journal - after I killed that guy with my pen..."<br class="u-margin-bottom-small-1">
"I'm not too quick to hit anymore. Before, you could say anything and I'd go off like that and the first thing that would come to my mind is "hit 'em."  Now, I take consideration. People are telling me about my attitudes changing. I found it myself..."<sup>1</sup>

To see them giving each other big hugs at the workshops, without any words needing to be said, is so touching."<sup>4</sup>
