                  <p>
                The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method can transform the lives of offenders in a fundamental and permanent way in a cost-effective manner. We have conducted workshops throughout the criminal justice system for both men and women and at minimum and maximum security facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                Our program can help offenders in a number of ways. In essence, it helps participants connect at a deep inner level with their true self and more fully realize their human potential and value as a person. They give recognition to their feelings, coming to terms with painful experiences about which they were in denial, and realizing how their attitudes and behavior are impacting the status of their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            As a result, it is not uncommon to witness sizable changes in behavior. Offenders treat other inmates with greater respect; they see them as persons who are similarly living with a painful past. Prison officials find that offenders treat them with greater respect. Dr. Harvey Shrum reports that they need less depression medication. We see these changes even with offenders who have life-time prison sentences.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Why does the Progoff methodology help offenders?
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The method is a <strong>powerful psychological tool</strong> that can help people of different backgrounds make major strides in their self-development. Therefore, offenders who take the process seriously can similarly benefit from participating in an excellent program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method employs<strong> minimal terminology</strong>; participants with a low level of education or interest in self-development programs can benefit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Offenders become <strong>immersed in their own process</strong>. The process captivates them - they are dealing with their own lives, finding answers for themselves. The exercises bypass preconceived ways of thinking to help them focus inward on themselves which is of great interest.
                    </li>

                      <blockquote>
                "I observed how quiet it was. The journal had gripped not only me: everyone was lost in the adventure toward self...Something had been opened in each of our lives."
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                  Progoff believes that fundamental change takes place when a person works in a deep inner level using the <em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises.

                    The <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshop becomes a life changing experience.
