                  <p>
                  Dialogue House is seeking to organize independent research studies to determine the  effectiveness of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method in helping spur offender rehabilitation. These studies could be done with offenders who are either incarcerated or not. We are especially interested in measuring the short-term impact of using our method over a six to nine month period upon behavior and attitude of offenders.

                  <p>
                    Please contact Jon Progoff at 800-221-5844 or email: info@intensivejournal.org for more information if you would like to help us organize a study.

                    Folsom State Prison Study by Harvey Shrum, Ed.D
                  </h1>

                  <p>
                    Dr. Harvey Shrum tracked the recidivism rate over 100 inmates who attended at least one <em>Intensive Journal</em> program while incarcerated at Folsom Prison. Dr. Shrum concluded:

                    <p>
                      "Through [the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method’s] non-judgmental, non-analytical nature, it gives the writer a mirroring capability that increases the energy, power, and effectiveness of the process over time. This experience has an empowering effect upon the <em>Intensive Journal</em> writer."

                      Reduced Recidivism:

                    <p>
                      "In the ten years since its introduction at Folsom State Prison, not one inmate who had completed at least the introductory <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshop returned to prison."

                    <p>
                      "Without therapeutic intervention shortly after these events, they [inmates] became at greater risk for antisocial behavior, low-self-esteem, depression, low educational attainment, underemployment, substance abuse, mental illness, and suicidal ideation. The <em>Intensive Journal</em> program helped them to deal with their issues in a safe, supporting environment."

                      Proven Record of Offender Rehabilitation:

                    <p>
                    "The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method also holds great promise in rehabilitating inmates as well as preventing young people from taking the path that often leads to addictions and incarceration. It is...conducive in fostering self-improvement,...fostering/developing vocational interests, in increasing awareness and healing of health, addictions, and relationships. It...improves writing and communication skills, enhances relationships with family, and achieves breakthroughs in issues and decision-making."
