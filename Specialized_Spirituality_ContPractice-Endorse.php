                      What appears on the surface to be an inner dialogue between myself and contents of my past is, from the

                  The <em>Intensive Journal</em> structure is a vehicle for such interior dialogue, which is a form of prayer.

                      “I have found the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method to be an
excellent complement to centering prayer/contemplative
practice in which I have practiced for over 20 years. It
provides many practical exercises for conducting the deep
inner work for connecting with my true self and experiencing God’s presence within.

Conducted in a quiet reflective atmosphere, the Intensive
Journal method is compatible with our practices in
centering prayer/contemplative practice, a companion on
my lifelong journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth.
I strongly encourage you to attend these workshops."
