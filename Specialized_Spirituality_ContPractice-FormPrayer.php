                  <h1><em>Intensive Journal</em> Method: A Form of Prayer</h1>

                  <p>
                    The format of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> workbook and its individual exercises, and the workshop
atmosphere are some of the reasons that the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method has been viewed as a form of
prayer
                  </p>

                  <h6>Prayer and meditation in the midst of life:</h6>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Progoff states that the<blockquote>
"<em>Intensive Journal</em> work is indeed a type of prayer and meditation but not in isolation from life
and not in place of active life involvement. Rather, it is meditation in the midst of the reality
of our life experiences. It draws upon the actualities of life for new awarenesses, and it feeds
these back into the movement of each life as a whole." </blockquote><sup>1</sup>
                  </p>

                  <h6>Atmosphere for prayer:</h6>
                  <p>
                    The inward movement of the method creates an inherently meditative
quality where the workshops have reminded participants "of profound prayer or of deep
meditation." (AJW p 8) Prayer requires a "special condition of being, an inner state of unity, freed
from the interventions of his [her] conscious ego, in which the ground of his [her] being was
connected with an at-one with the abiding reality of God."<sup>2</sup>
                  </p>

                  <h6>Being in relationship with God:</h6>
                  <p>
                    The essence of prayer is being in relationship with God. A key
    aspect of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method is being in relationship with major aspects of your life,
    including wisdom figures such as God. These exercises help you gain unpredictable insights as you
    deepen your connection to each area.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Adopting an accepting and non-judgmental approach:</h6>
                  <p>
                    Effective prayer requires each of us to bare
  our soul to God to accept divine wisdom and forgiveness. We work in the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method
  using a non-judgmental approach, recording both positive and negative thoughts as a way to
  honestly connect with the full scope of our lives.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Repetitive meditative breathing exercises:</h6>
                  <p>
                    The <em>Intensive Journal</em> method uses a repetitive
meditative breathing exercise that is called the Mantra/Crystal exercise, to create a great energy and
atmosphere for wisdom.
                  </p>
