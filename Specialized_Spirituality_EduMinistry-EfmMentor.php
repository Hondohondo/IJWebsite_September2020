                  <h1>Approved as Alternate EfM Mentor Training</h1>

<p>
  <em>Intensive Journal</em> workshops can count as Alternate Mentor Training for EfM mentors.
Requirements for Alternate Mentor Training include having completed two Foundations Trainings
(formerly Basic/In-Service), being “Formation ready,” not having completed another Alternate Training
within the last three trainings, and not needing to go back to Foundations after three Formations.
Contact Elsa Bakkum, EfM Associate Director for Training, at esbakkum@sewanee.edu for Alternate
Training credit. Note: Each full length (12 hour) <em>Intensive Journal</em> module is 11 contact hours. While
attending two workshops satisfies the contact hours requirement, attending the integrative aspects of
the method in part 3 is also recommended
