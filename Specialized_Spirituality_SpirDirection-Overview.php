                  <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
  The Progoff TM   methodology provides both spiritual directors and directees with an
integrated system of writing exercises for personal and spiritual growth. The deepening atmosphere and unique structure of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises provide the opportunity for profound inner experience.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>Intensive Journal</em> program provides a practical tool to use in spiritual direction.   Our method provides spiritual directors with fresh processes for spiritual growth to develop and integrate life experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Directees tend to become more engaged in their own development as they use our process to uncover and develop issues and experiences.  Material developed through the <em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises can be integrated into the spiritual direction sessions.
</p>

<p>
  The net result is our method can help to make the spiritual direction sessions more effective and to provide a life-long tool for ongoing spiritual growth.
</p>
