                  <h6>New Audio CDs</h6>
                  <p>

                    Our audio and book catalogue is available as well as a description on our website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  We are updating our inventory and are now accepting orders for our new audio CDs.
                   Your request will be processed as soon as possible but the timing will depend upon the flow of orders. Please allow at least eight weeks for shipment.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    These audio CDs will help you deepen your understanding and work in the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method.
                    You can use the Entrance meditation recordings to center yourself as you use the method on your own.
                    The Progoff lecture series and interviews offer you insight into Dr. Progoff’s philosophy of human development and rationale for creating the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method.
                  </p>


                  <p>
                    Considerable effort has been made to enhance the quality of these recordings as many were recorded live several years ago.
                    However, I think you will find that the quality is more than adequate for your needs.
                  </p>



                  <p>
You may order by calling 800-221-5844 or by completing the order form in our audio and book catalogue or on our website.
While we accept credit card payment by telephone or through the order form sent by mail, payment cannot be made directly online.
 I hope you will be able to take advantage of this opportunity.
                   </p>
