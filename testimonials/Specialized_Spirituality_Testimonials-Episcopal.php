"Clergy self-care is so important when it comes to being an effective leader of a congregation. I’ve always enjoyed journaling as a way to 'keep my head above water,' but it was through the <em>Intensive Journal</em> program that my skill at reflective writing deepened and blossomed. Now I am able to use the <em>Intensive Journal</em> method for my spiritual growth and development as I recognize connections I hadn’t noticed before – relationship patterns, recurring themes, ongoing struggles. I feel more connected to my inner being and that frees me to experience my connectedness to other people and to God in a much more responsive way."

                  Through the process, I realized that in some ways I had been thinking of myself as a prodigal daughter. Yet, from the ashes of whatever I felt I had 'wasted,' the phoenix arose. This phoenix was not a bird: it was my self...my self, I believe, as Jesus of Nazareth meant when he said love God and thy neighbor as thyself. Age-old anger began to melt. Life looked and sounded and felt new, as if I were a child again, a child coming home."
